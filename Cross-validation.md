# Overview
Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The procedure has a single parameter called `k` that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. When a specific value for k is chosen, it may be used in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k=10 becoming 10-fold cross-validation.

This function prepares data for cross-validation:
```python
def get_k_fold_data(k, i, X, y):
    assert k > 1
    fold_size = X.shape[0] // k
    X_train, y_train = None, None
    for j in range(k):
        idx = slice(j * fold_size, (j + 1) * fold_size)
        X_part, y_part = X[idx, :], y[idx]
        if j == i:
            X_valid, y_valid = X_part, y_part
        elif X_train is None:
            X_train, y_train = X_part, y_part
        else:
            X_train = torch.cat([X_train, X_part], 0)
            y_train = torch.cat([y_train, y_part], 0)
    return X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid
```
This function provides the k-fold scores:
```python
def k_fold(k, X_train, y_train, num_epochs, learning_rate, weight_decay,
           batch_size):
    train_l_sum, valid_l_sum = 0, 0
    for i in range(k):
        data = get_k_fold_data(k, i, X_train, y_train)
        net = get_net()
        train_ls, valid_ls = train(net, *data, num_epochs, learning_rate,
                                   weight_decay, batch_size)
        train_l_sum += train_ls[-1]
        valid_l_sum += valid_ls[-1]
        if i == 0:
            d2l.plot(list(range(1, num_epochs + 1)), [train_ls, valid_ls],
                     xlabel='epoch', ylabel='rmse', xlim=[1, num_epochs],
                     legend=['train', 'valid'], yscale='log')
        print(f'fold {i + 1}, train log rmse {float(train_ls[-1]):f}, '
              f'valid log rmse {float(valid_ls[-1]):f}')
    return train_l_sum / k, valid_l_sum / k
```

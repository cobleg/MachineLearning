# Overview
Classification refers to machine learning algorithms that make choices between mutually exclusive classes (aka categories). The simplest form is binary classification (i.e. {0, 1}, {yes, no}, {true, false} choices).

As indicated with binary choices, the classes are contained within a list of items. More generally, this is described as discrete choice.

# Function to fit to discrete choices
There are various clasification models such as the:
- [[logistic model]]

# Decision boundary
In designing a classification algorithm, it is useful to consider how to define the [[decision boundary]].

# Cost & loss functions for non-linear classification models
Non-linear models such as the [[logistic model]] require a specialised [[cost function]] corresponding to a [[loss function]].

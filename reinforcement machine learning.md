# Overview
> Reinforcement learning (RL) is a major branch of machine learning that is concerned with how to learn control laws and policies to interact with a complex environment from experience.

In reinforcement learning, an agent senses the state of its environment and learns to take appropriate actions to optimise future rewards. The ultimate goal in reinforcement learning is to learn an effective control strategy

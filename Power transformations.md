# Overview
Power transformations are a type of feature engineering that assists in improving the performance of machine learning algorithms.

# Types of power transformations
There are various types of power transformations, such as:
- raising a variable by an exponent (e.g. 0.5, 2, 3, ...)
- logarithmic transformation (e.g. natural log transform)
- Box-Cox transformation

# Rationale
Rationale for transforming the data:
- achieving a better fit between the input and output variables
- reducing the skewness in the distribution of sampled data

## Better fit

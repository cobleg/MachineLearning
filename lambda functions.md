# Overview
The `lambda function` in [[Python]] is based on [lamda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).  In short, a `lambda function` is an anonymous function that binds one or more variables to a function. 

A `lambda expression` is a `lambda function` written in a computer language such as [[Python]] and has the following structure:
- The keyword: lambda
- A bound variable:
- A body

A example is 
```Python 
lambda x: x + 1
```
The result can be printed to the console using this code:
```python
(lambda x: x + 1)(10)
```

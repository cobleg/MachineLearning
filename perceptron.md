# Overview
A [perceptron](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/deep-learning-tutorial/perceptron) is a function that maps its input `x` which is multiplied with the learned weight coefficient; an output value `f(x)` is generated:

$$ f(x)= \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x} \ + b > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise }
\end{cases}
$$
where
$\boldsymbol{w}$ is a vector of real-valued weights
$\boldsymbol{x}$ is a vector of input values
$b$ is the bias, a scalar that adjusts the boundary away from the origin without any dependence on the input value

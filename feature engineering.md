# Overview
According to Wikipedia
> **Feature engineering** or **feature extraction** or **feature discovery** is the process of using [domain knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge "Domain knowledge") to extract [features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning) "Feature (machine learning)") (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data"). The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") process, compared with supplying only the raw data to the machine learning process.
